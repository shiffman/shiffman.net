<p>School is out for summer so I&#8217;m taking a break from teaching classes in order to teach (?!?!) workshops.  I just returned from a lovely visit to Amsterdam, where I led two full-day intensive Processing workshops at <a href="://www.mediamatic.net/">Mediamatic</a>.  I also was super thrilled to present with <a href="http://blog.blprnt.com">Jer Thorp</a> at Mediamatic&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mediamatic.net/page/148710/en">Processing Salon</a>.  Jer&#8217;s work is fantastic and inspiring. His presentation was one of the highlights of my trip.</p>

<p>Next stop a 3-day advanced Processing workshop with the <a href="http://www.master-naba-d3d.net/">D3D masters students</a> at <a href="http://www.naba.it">Naba</a> in Milan.  I was lucky enough to be in Milan for the opening of <a href="http://www.triennale.it/index.php?id=1&#038;tbl=0&#038;idq=1232">Triennale&#8217;s Design of the Other Things</a> exhibit, which included work by <a href="http://www.massimobanzi.com/">Massimo Banzi</a> of <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> fame.  Also, a special thanks to <a href="http://www.filippovanucci.com/">Filippo Vanucci</a> who came in as a guest presenter to talk about his ITP thesis project: <a href="http://scrollabl.es/">Scrollables</a>.</p>
<p>This month, I&#8217;ll be teaching a few sessions at ITP&#8217;s new <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/camp">Summer Camp (for grownups)</a> as well as two Processing workshops at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.offf.ws/#workshops">OFFF</a>.  I&#8217;ve been getting many e-mail questions regarding what exactly will be covered at the OFFF workshops so here&#8217;s a quick outline for anyone thinking of attending.</p>
