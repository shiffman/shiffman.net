<p>Today in my <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/">Programming from A to Z</a> course we&#8217;ll be going over <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/concordance/">how to program a simple concordance in Java</a> storing words in a binary search tree.  It may be hairy, but I hope it proves to be a useful means for improving the programming skills of <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu">ITP</a> students. . . if any data structure / algorithm gurus wander by this site, please feel free to correct any mistakes i&#8217;ve made in this initial <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/concordance/">tutorial</a>. . . being the severely flawed human being that i am, i&#8217;m sure they exist. . </p>
