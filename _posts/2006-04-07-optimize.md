<p>If you look at my <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code/">nature of code</a> <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code/steering/">flocking</a> example, you&#8217;ll notice that the algorithm involves calculating the distance between all of the system&#8217;s elements, i.e. for every &#8220;boid&#8221;, check and see how far away it is from every other boid.  This works quite well for, say, around 100 elements.</p>
<p>100 x 100 = 10,000 cycles.  No problem.</p>
<p>To check 1,000 elements:</p>
<p>1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000 cycles.  Ok, but getting a bit slow. . .</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try 2,000 elements:</p>
<p>2,000 x 2,000 elements = 4,000,000 cycles.  Now, we&#8217;re really getting slow.  Really, <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/p5/intersection/slow">see how slow it is</a>.</p>
<p>What if we could divide the screen into a grid of arbitrary size, take all 2,000 elements, and each object&#8217;s location within that grid?  Then, we could simply test the objects that were in the same relative area at any given moment.  Imagine a 10 x 10 grid.   In a system of 2,000 elements, on average, approximately 20 elements would be found in each cell (20 x 10 x 10 = 2,000).</p>
<p>Each cell would then require 20 x 20 = 400 cycles.  With 100 cells, we&#8217;d have 100 x 400 = 40,000 cycles, a massive savings over 4,000,000.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.shiffman.net/p5/intersection/fast">Here&#8217;s an example that implements this optimization</a>.  It&#8217;s a great deal more efficient than this <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/p5/intersection/slow">slow, pathetic version</a>.  The code could use some fixing up and could be improved to be more modular / object oriented, but it&#8217;s a nice start for solving these types of problems.  We could also use a potentially more efficient data structure than an <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> for every cell.</p>
