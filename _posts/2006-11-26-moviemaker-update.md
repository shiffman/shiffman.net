<p>I&#8217;ve updated the Processing <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/2006/05/18/moviemaker/">moviemaker</a> library.  Implemented more codecs and I think I fixed the Intel Mac bugs (but no way to tell since I don&#8217;t have one.)  Hopefully nothing else broke in the process.  Anyone reading this on an intel mac or windows machine, please test and let me know, thanks!   Oh, and documentation coming soon!</p>
