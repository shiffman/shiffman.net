<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that we&#8217;re releasing the first version of <a href="http://www.mostpixelsever.com/">The Most Pixels Ever</a>, an open-source Java framework for spanning Processing sketches across multiple screens (developed with Chris Kairalla).  This is an early version that has many limitations and needs a great deal of improvement, but <a href="http://www.mostpixelsever.com/2007/08/26/testing-on-the-iac-video-wall/">it does work</a>.  The site isn&#8217;t complete, but the <a href="http://www.mostpixelsever.com/source/">source</a> is available, and there are a <a href="http://www.mostpixelsever.com/tutorial/">couple tutorials</a> to help get your started.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be using the library in conjunction with <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching">teaching</a> a <a href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Syllabus/BigScreens">new class</a> at ITP starting today!</p>
