<a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code/vectors/">week 2 tutorial &#8212; Vectors</a></p>
<p>Week two of the <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code">nature of code</a> tutorials is up.  I guess I don&#8217;t really need to post announcements here each time a new tutorial goes up, but at least it gives the appearance that I&#8217;m keeping this blog (oh dear, I have a blog, how embarrasing) up-to-date. . .   </p>
<p>Oh, and for that matter, <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/regex/">a new tutorial about regular expressions in Java</a> for the <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/">Programming from A to Z</a> class is available too.  Let the world of regular expression masters slowly pick it apart for all its inadequacies. . .</p>
