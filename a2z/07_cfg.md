## Exercise ideas
* Rework any of the example programs to use something other than text (or, at least, text that represents language) as its basic unit. For example: musical notes, songs in playlists, pixels in an image, etc.
* Invent your own grammar. Consider using one that generates something other English sentences: music, images, code, etc.
* Build a grammar that pulls its terminal words from [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/).
* Build a grammar based on a source text [as demonstrated here](https://shiffman.github.io/A2Z-F17/week7-cfg/04_cfg_generate_grammar/) — [source code](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/tree/master/week7-cfg/04_cfg_generate_grammar).  

## Grammars

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">Wikipedia</a>:  “Grammar is the study of the rules governing the use of a given natural language, and, as such, is a field of linguistics. Traditionally, grammar included morphology and syntax; in modern linguistics these subfields are complemented by phonetics, phonology, semantics, and pragmatics.”

A [Context-Free Grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) is a set of rules that define the syntax of a language — what is and is not a valid sequence of “tokens”.   Programming languages, for example, are context-free grammars — a compiler reads your code to make sure it conforms to specific rules and informs you of any errors.   (These rules aren’t limited to the production of text, and can be used for music, visual designs, etc.) A context-free grammar, however, isn’t robust enough to describe the complexities of natural language. After all, they have no context! Natural languages can be described using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar">Context-sensitive grammars</a>, a concept introduced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Chomsky</a> in the 50s.

Here, I will demontrate how to use libraries to generate text with a Context Free Grammar as well as program your own from scratch. want to learn how to define our own context free grammars and generate text from them.  I’m going to give a short explanations, followed by code examples.  For more detailed discussions, I would recommend [Daniel Howe’s (creator of RiTa) explanation](http://www.rednoise.org/pdal/index.php?n=Main.Grammars) and [Context-Free Grammars by Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/teaching/rwet/recursion-and-context-free-grammars/).

All “production rules” in a context-free grammar are of the form:

{% highlight text %}
V -> w
{% endhighlight %}

where `V` is a single “non-terminal” and `w` is a sequence of “terminals” and “non-terminals”

A non-terminal symbol is simply another symbol which needs to be defined in another production rule.  A terminal symbol does not need to be defined because that’s it, you’ve reached the end, what is here is what should be in the sentence itself.  Here’s an incredibly simple CFG.

{% highlight text %}
s -> a b
a -> 'the'
b -> c 'cat'
c -> 'happy'
c -> 'sad'
{% endhighlight %}

Anything in single quotes is a “terminal” element, meaning this is the end and no more substitutions are necessary.  In the above “cat,” “happy,” and “sad” are all terminals. Anything that is not in quotes is non-terminal, or a “symbol.”  The abve example has 4 symbols — s, a, b, c. The symbol “s” is commonly used to indicate “start” or “sentence.”

Notice how in the above set of rules the symbol c can be “happy” or “sad.”   This is often express with an OR (pipe character) to combine these two rules:

{% highlight text %}
c -> 'happy' | 'sad'
{% endhighlight %}

Again, this grammar is incredibly basic, and is just for demonstrating how the elements work.  The only two valid “sentences” that conform to this grammar are:

{% highlight text %}
the happy cat
the sad cat
{% endhighlight %}

The process of generating the above two sentences goes something like:

`s` becomes `a b` which becomes `the c cat` which then becomes `the happy cat` or `the sad cat`.  Here, either “happy” or “sad” is picked randomly (with a 50% chance for each one.)

## Tracery

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3EwsSNJeOE?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Y7iXZe_8XKJhaw_kRo8REO" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

A great way to get started experimenting with CFG text generation is to use a library. One of my favorites is [Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/). With Tracery, all you need to do is setup your grammar as a JSON object.  Here's a very simple example grammar:

{% highlight javascript %}
var story = {
  "start": ['Once upon a time, there was a #adj# #hero#'.],
  "hero": ['fairy', 'unicorn', 'dragon', 'bear'],
  "adj": ['smart', 'pretty', 'smelly', 'funny', 'angry']
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note how `#adj#` is surrounded by the `#` symbol. This indicates that it is a "non-terminal" element and should be replaced with a random element from the `adj` property of `story`.  These types of replacement rules can be nested and result in complex outcomes. To generate the story, a grammar object is created from the above `story` data.  Any given outcome can be "expanded" from a starting element (like `#start#`) and then "flattened" (meaning we just want the final result, not the full expansion tree.)

{% highlight javascript %}
var grammar = tracery.createGrammar(story);
var expansion = grammar.flatten('#start#');
{% endhighlight %}

## CFG with RiTa.js

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VaAoIaZ3YKs?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Y7iXZe_8XKJhaw_kRo8REO" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

The [RiTa.js library](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS) also includes Context Free Grammars as a feature with the `RiGrammar` object. You can create a grammar in code by creating a grammar object and adding rules..

{% highlight javascript %}
var grammar = new RiGrammar();
grammar.addRule('<start>', 'Once upon a time, there was a <adj> <hero>.');
grammar.addRule('<hero>', 'fairy | unicorn | dragon | bear');
grammar.addRule('<adj>', 'smart | pretty | smelly | funny | angry');
{% endhighlight %}

RiTa looks for a rule that begins with `<start>` to generate the text with `expand()`.

{% highlight javascript %}
var story = grammar.expand();
{% endhighlight %}

RiTa also allows you pass a third argument (weight) to each rule to increase the probability of a particular option being selected.  And finally, RiTa  allows you to load grammars from a file (formatted with JSON or YAML) with `loadFrom()`.

## Coding your own CFG

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Z9FRiW2Jlc?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Y7iXZe_8XKJhaw_kRo8REO" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

How do we build a data structure to track a context-free grammar if you want to program your own from scratch?  Again, I'm going to use a JavaScript object just like with the concordance and N-gram analysis examples.  Here we'll take a production rule and map non-terminal characters to keys and the possible outcomes as an array of values.

{% highlight javascript %}
var cfg = {
  's': [['a', 'b']],
  'a': [['the']],
  'b': [['c', 'cat']],
  'c': [['happy'], ['sad']]
};
{% endhighlight %}

The above may look a little strange to you.  Notice how the value for each key is an array of arrays.  Each element of the larger array is one possible outcome which is an array itself: the list of elements in that outcome.  I should also note that the is no distinction between a “symbol” and a “terminal.”  Everything is just a String, if there is a rule associated with that String then it is a symbol, if not, it's terminal.

A generated sentence from the CFG is commonly referred to as an “expansion” and is a bit tricky to implement.  We could try to just use a loop, iterating over a sentence and executing the production rules.  The nested nature of the rules, however, introduces a great deal of complexity.  An elegant strategy, however, is to call a function recursively expanding the same sentence over and over again until there are no non-terminal elements left.  Let's assume we have an empty array and some seed (often called an "axiom").

{% highlight javascript %}
var expansion = [];
var seed = 's';
{% endhighlight %}

We can write a function that receives both the array and the seed and calls itself recursively if a rule that matches that seed String is present.

{% highlight javascript %}
function expand(start, expansion) {
  if (cfg.hasOwnProperty(start)) {
    // Grab one possible expansion
    var possible = rules[start];
    var random_expansion = choice(possible);
    // Call this method again with the current element
    for (var i = 0; i < random_expansion.length; i++) {
      expand(random_expansion[i], expansion);
    }
  // if the rule wasn't found, then it's a terminal:
  // append the string to the expansion
  } else {
    expansion.push(start);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The [full implementation of the CFG object can be found here](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/blob/master/week7-cfg/01_cfg_raw/cf.js).  In addition, here are some sample grammars: [creating a grammar in code](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/blob/master/week7-cfg/01_cfg_raw/sketch.js), [a grammar file](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/blob/master/week7-cfg/02_cfg_reader/test.grammar), [a grammar files as JSON](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F15/tree/master/week8/03_cfg_reader_json/grammars/grammar.json), [haiku grammar file as JSON](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/blob/master/week7-cfg/03_cfg_reader_json/grammars/haiku.json).  These grammars come from [Allison Parrish](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet-examples) and [Daniel Howe](http://rednoise.org/rita/).

Finally, a grammar file is something you can generate yourself based on some algorithm.  For example, using [this haiku grammar file from Daniel Howe](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/blob/master/week7-cfg/03_cfg_reader_json/grammars/haiku.json), you could read in a source text, analyze the syllable counts of all the words, and rewrite the grammar file to reflect these new words.  Here is a version of this grammar file using words from an Obama speech: [generated_grammar.json](http://shiffman.net/a2z/generated_grammar.g).

Here is an [example that uses a concordance to get al the words from a source file and the RiTa library to count syllables](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F17/tree/master/week7-cfg/04_cfg_generate_grammar).

## More on Recursion

If the concept of recursion in the `expand()` function above is confusing to you, this video about recursion in algorithmic drawing from [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com) may help.

## L-Systems

Finally, another example of a Context-Free Grammar is an [L-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), a grammar used to generated growth patterns found in nature.
