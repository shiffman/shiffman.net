<p>Hello world.</p>
<p>I have completely failed to remember I have a blog.  Well, I suppose it wasn&#8217;t a failure of memory, rather it just fell out of my routine to keep things up-to-date.  When you have one of these jobs at an academic institution, one thing they require you to do every so often is put together a big pile of paper that provides evidence you are contributing member of society.  The way I&#8217;ve always managed to do that in the past is by scanning through all my old posts to find out if I have in fact done anything.  According to this blog, I have not existed since April 2011.  I&#8217;m going to try to remedy that.  The first thing I&#8217;m going to do is post a list of things I&#8217;ve been up to in the last seven or eight months (this is for me and anyone reading should really just stop reading).  The second thing I&#8217;m going to do (starting tonight) is simultaneously attempt to revive this blog and celebrate the festival of lights by posting eight nights of Processing examples.  I&#8217;ve made a few new ones for the upcoming Processing 2.0 release as well as helped out students on a number of different problems over the course of the fall semester.  So hopefully this can be a place where I can document and share some of these examples in the hopes that they will help others.</p>
<p>So first, the part everyone should feel free to ignore. . .</p>
<ul>
<li>April 2011. I visited my good friend <a href="http://www.talespin.com/">Chris Ault</a> at The College of New Jersey and gave a presentation about the Nature of Code and Most Pixels Ever and saw several demos of student work.</li>
<li>June 2011. I attended Seb Lee-Delisle&#8217;s <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/training/">Creative JS</a> course in NYC.  I made this: <a href="http://shiffman.net/creativejs/particles.html">fibonacci particles</a></li>
<li>June 17-20 2011. I participated in the Processing 2.0 summit. Ben Fry, Casey Reas, Andres Colubri, Jer Thorp, Patrick Hebron, and I worked together to define the 2.0 release.  (Thanks to Casey for the photos below.)</li>

<li>Summer 2011. I participated in Google Summer of Code as a mentor for Processing.</li>
<li>September 2011. Launched the &#8220;Magic Book&#8221; project with Rune Madsen and Miguel Bermudez at ITP (stay tuned for more about this).</li>
<li>October 2011. I attended IndieCade in Los Angeles and participated in a panel discussion with Zach Gage, Robert Hodgin, and Casey Reas, and Daniel Shiffman.  We discussed projects which use code as a generator of form, and explore the various ways in which procedurally generated elements can contribute to the mechanics, dynamics, and/or aesthetics of video games. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edor4shC-pY">video of the panel</a>).</li>
<li>October 2011. Attended Art &#038;&#038; Code 3D and was proud to be Greg Borenstein&#8217;s helper for his workshop <a href="http://artandcode.com/3d/workshops/1a-using-the-kinect-with-processing">Using the Kinect with Processing</a>.  Also really enjoyed Stephen Howell&#8217;s Scratch + Kinect workshop.</li>
<li>November 2011. Began development on a <a href="http://www.itpcakemix.com/">CakeMix</a> Processing library. Source on <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/CakeMix-Processing">github</a>.
</li>
<li>Fall 2011. Technical edited Greg Borenstein&#8217;s upcoming book: <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020684.do">Making Things See</a>.</li>
<li>December 2011. Gave a presentation at the Neuberger Museum of Art as part of the <a href="https://drupalsites.purchase.edu/newmedia/index.php?q=node/150">New Media Lecture Series</a></li>
<li>December 2011.  Completing work on Processing 2.0.  New examples, new tutorials. Stay tuned for further updates</li>
<p>.
</ul>
<p>Next up, 8 Processing examples!</p>
