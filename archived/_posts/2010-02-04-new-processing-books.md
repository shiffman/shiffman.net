<p>It seems like every day I hear about another Processing book being published (or soon to be published).  Joshua Noble&#8217;s recent book includes Processing along with openFrameworks and Arduino: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596154143?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=learniproces-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0596154143">Programming Interactivity: A Designer&#8217;s Guide to Processing, Arduino, and Openframeworks</a>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680721X?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=learniproces-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=059680721X">Processing for Visual Artists</a> is another new book I know little about, but am excited to check out.  And I&#8217;m particularly thrilled for the upcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144937980X?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=learniproces-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=144937980X">Getting Started with Processing</a>.  An inexpensive, short beginner&#8217;s guide is a big gaping hole in the landscape of Processing books and this book should fill it nicely.  It&#8217;s really what I imagined <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com">Learning Processing: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide</a> to be, but the book ballooned a bit into a more comprehensive beginner textbook.  Hopefully Casey and Ben&#8217;s new book can introduce a lot of new people to Processing.</p>
<p>Finally, Ira Greenberg&#8217;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219793?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=learniproces-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=1430219793">The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers</a> recently came out. And if you didn&#8217;t notice, I wrote the forward!  Which, strangely enough, means that my name is somehow on the cover along with Ira&#8217;s.  Which is pretty crazy considering that I only wrote a few short paragraphs.</p>
<p>Oh and I still am working on a <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com/noc/">The Nature of Code</a> book, with more PDF chapters to be available soon!</p>
