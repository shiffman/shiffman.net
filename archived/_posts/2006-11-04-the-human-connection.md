<p><a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/42869">An article about ITP</a> was published yesterday in the <a href="http://www.nysun.com/">New York Sun</a>.  Now, I&#8217;m no fan of this newspaper (see <a href="http://www.nysun.com/editorials_opinion.php">their editorials</a>, which I couldn&#8217;t  bear to read), but they do have excellent arts coverage, and they did capture ITP quite well.  But did I really say this?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, it&#8217;s about the human connection â€” what technology can do for us.&#8221;</p>
