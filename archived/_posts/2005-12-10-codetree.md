<p><a href="http://www.codetree.org">CodeTree</a> by <a href="http://www.mandalatv.net/">Rich Hauck</a> is up and running in beta.   CodeTree is Rich&#8217;s thesis project at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu">ITP</a>. . .  At Rich&#8217;s thesis presentation, there was some discussion about how CodeTree can more effectively create social interactions between programmers (as opposed to simply being a place to &#8220;broadcast&#8221; one&#8217;s work).   I&#8217;m particularly interesting in the <i>tree</i> aspect, i.e. seeing how example code from my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching">courses</a> branches out into other projects.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a terrific project.   <a href="http://www.codetree.org">check it out</a>!   I look forward to posting more code examples and little sketches there. </p>
