<p>I&#8217;m just finishing up another trip to Savannah, GA.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.telfair.org/about/tech_week.asp">Art &#038; Technology Week</a> here at the Telfair Museum.  I participated in two programs, a workshop at the Moses Jackson Community Center and a demo for high school students at the Jepson Center. Haeyoung Kim (who performs under the name <a href="http://www.bubblyfish.com/">bubblyfish</a>) also spoke.   I really enjoyed learning about 8-bit music and am interesting in playing around with <a href="http://nanoloop.com/">nanoloop</a>.  I hope to catch some of her performances in New York!</p>
<p>I also installed my new work, <i>Garden</i>.  Oh geez, I just used Youtube again.</p>
