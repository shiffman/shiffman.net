<p>It&#8217;s taken me a little while, but here&#8217;s a brief recap of what was quite possibly the most heart-warming and thrilling conference I will ever have the chance to attend &#8212; <a href="http://artandcode.ning.com/">ART + CODE</a>: a symposium on programming environments for artists, young people, and the rest of us. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shiffman/3334083196/" title="IMG_7189 by shiffman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3618/3334083196_08752c0905_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_7189" /></a></p>
<p>First, a hearty thank you to <a href="http://www.flong.com/">Golan Levin</a> who did a tremendous job planning and organizing the mind-bending experience.   Some highlights:</p>

<p>Oxford Project Part III &#8212; Thanks to the ever ebullient <a href="http://iragreenberg.net/">Ira Greenberg</a> and Miami University for sponsoring (and the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/studio/">Studio for Creative Inquiry</a> @ CMU for giving us space), we were able to convene before the main festivities began to give <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> a push towards some number past 1.0.   Stay tuned for exciting improvements in Processing&#8217;s video and OPENGL libraries as well as to the IDE itself.</p>

<p>Saturday was a day full of workshops.  In the morning, I attempted to teach an entire semester of <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Syllabus/ICM-All-F08">ICM</a> in under three hours, followed by an afternoon mix of topics related to physics simulation and image processing.</p>

<p>Sunday was the day to end all days with the lineup of speakings including lead developers of the languages / environments: <a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a>, <a href="http://puredata.info/">Pure Data</a>, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a href="http://hacketyhack.net/">Hackety Hack, </a><a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, <a href="http://www.cycling74.com/">Max/MSP/Jitter</a>, <a href="http://vvvv.org/">vvvv</a>, <a href="http://blog.drwoohoo.com/?cat=113">ExtendScript</a>, and <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>.   Some highlights within highlights here were Luke Dubois&#8217; demo of &#8220;what is known in the biz as random atonal crap&#8221; and Sebastian Oschatz&#8217;s boy band metaphor for multi-screen setups (one that I really need to take a look at more closely as we develop &#8220;most pixels ever&#8221; at ITP.)  Videos of all the Sunday talks will eventually be posted at <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/artandcode">vimeo/artandcode</a>.</p>

<p>On Monday, I was lucky to have the chance before heading home to catch the work of <a href="http://reas.com/">Casey Reas</a> and <a href="http://www.unlekker.net/">Marius Watz</a> at the <a href="http://www.pittsburgharts.org/index.php">Pittsburgh Center for the Arts</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this was really just an excuse for a nice group photo.</p>
