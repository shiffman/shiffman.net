<p>The <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/bigscreens2007">Big Screens</a> class has kicked off again for this semester.  For all of you marking your calendars, the show will be Friday, Dec 12th, sometime in the evening.    The students are <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/BigScreens/ProjectIdeas-F08">proposing their project ideas</a> today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>In preparation for the class, I&#8217;ve updated the library with new tutorials and downloads.</p>

<p>Next week we&#8217;ll be running our first tests of content on the wall.  Stay tuned!  (Photos below from our first visit to IAC on Sept 12th.  They were nice enough to set up the giant lobby space as a classroom, complete with IAC paper and pencils.)</p>
