<p>Just wanted to give a quick plug to ITP student Sinan Ascioglu&#8217;s new site: <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org">www.openprocessing.org</a> &#8212; a community &#8220;flickr-like&#8221; site for Processing sketches.  It&#8217;s terrific work and I&#8217;m hoping students in my courses will find it helpful for organizing portfolios of their work.  I&#8217;m hoping to be able to help Sinan by figuring out a way to auto-generate thumbnails from uploaded Processing sketches.   Seems to be the one missing piece (it&#8217;s a pain in the neck to generate those screenshots yourself).  Any ideas?  Post here in the comments.</p>
