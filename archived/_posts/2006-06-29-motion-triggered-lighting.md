<p>Had a chance to experiment a bit more.  Created a very basic particle system, where particles are born via motion detection (simple webcam) and displayed as blobular things on the lighting fixture.  Graphics, network lighting control, and motion detection all done in <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>.  Hooray, the possibilities are endless. . .</p>
