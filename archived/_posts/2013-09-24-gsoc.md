2013 marks [The Processing Foundation](http://processing.org)'s third year participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).  Following is a summary of the four projects, in alphabetical order by project name, completed this summer by a terrific group of students.


1) [GUI Library for Processing](http://martinleopold.com/pui/) by [Martin Leopold](http://martinleopold.com/pui/) is a prototype for a new graphical user interface library for Processing.

2) [PDE X](http://www.mkmoharana.com/2013/09/announcing-pde-x.html) by [Manindra Moharana](http://www.mkmoharana.com/) is a Processing mode that augments the development environment with new features such as code completion, refactoring, real-time error checking, and debugging.  This is a continuation of Manindra's 2012 GSOC work and shows some future possibilities for the PDE.

3) [Serial Library for Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2093) by Gottfried Haider replaces Processing's existing RXTX-based serial library with one built on top of [Java Simple Serial Connector](https://code.google.com/p/java-simple-serial-connector/).   The core API remains the same, but this under the hood work allows Processing to better support all platforms.

4) [Tweak Mode](http://galsasson.com/tweakmode/) by [Gal Sasson](http://galsasson.com/index.html) is a Processing mode that allows "tweaking" of hard-coded numbers in a sketch's code through a user interface.  The user can tweak the values while the sketch is running and the sketch window updates in real-time.
