<p>Making its debut this weekend at <a href="http://vloggercon.blogspot.com/">VloggerCon</a> is <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/research/?page_id=34">Video Comments, A WordPress Plugin.</a>  Based on some <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/~dbo3/proj/timespace.htm">work by Dan O&#8217;Sullivan in the late 90s</a>, it&#8217;s the result of the tireless effort of the aforementioned <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/~dbo3/">Dan O&#8217;Sullivan</a>, <a href="http://www.walking-productions.com/shawn.html">Shawn Van Every</a>, <a href="http://www.base2john.com/">John Schimmel</a>, and <a href="http://uncleleron.com/">Josh Dickens</a>.   Oh, and I worked on it too.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/research/?page_id=34">downloading</a> and using the plug-in,  info is available on the <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/research/?page_id=34">ITP Research Web Site</a>.</p>
<p>If you download the plug-in, it&#8217;s important that you <a href="#" onClick="javascript:window.open('http://itp.nyu.edu/research/vc/download.php',' download','menubar=0,resizable=0,width=450,height=450')">submit your blog&#8217;s URL</a>.  Automatic categorization (or if I want to be all hip and cool. . .<i>tagging</i>) of video is not so easy without some super amazing braniac way of evaluating the pixels of the frames themselves.  What we&#8217;re doing is saying: &#8220;Well, people are chatting and commenting around video, what if used this existing metadata to find the natural relationships between videos, allowing for better search and browsing?&#8221;   We&#8217;re calling this concept video &#8220;flavors.&#8221; t&#8217;s a text analysis process for the auto-generation of tag-like keywords for video.   The strategies for this came out of examples from my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/">Programming from A to Z</a> course.   Right now, the algorithm is rather simplistic and I hope to improve / expand the analysis and resulting functionality over the summer.</p>
<p>Sheesh, I think this might be my longest blog post ever.   If you&#8217;re still reading at this point, I&#8217;m deeply honored. . .</p>
