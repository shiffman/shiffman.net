<p>A terrific programmer and artist <a href="http://www.toxi.co.uk/">toxi</a> has <a href="http://www.toxi.co.uk/blog/2006/01/note-this-article-is-using.htm">written up some thoughts</a> about &#8220;Code (with a capital C)&#8221; and <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>.   The post inspired <a href="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Collaboration;action=display;num=1137655161">a great deal of discussion on the Processing forum</a> as well as a <a href="http://www.toxi.co.uk/blog/2006/01/dissecting-discourse.htm">second</a> and <a href="http://www.toxi.co.uk/blog/2006/01/importance-of-design.htm">third</a> post on toxi&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>I was about to post some of my thoughts on the forum and here, but realized, eh, what do I really know.  Who better to respond and discuss this topic than those in my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code/">nature of code class</a>?   So, well, I made it &#8220;homework. . . &#8221;  Post away! (use the comments here to leave your response, but feel free to post to the Processing forum as well.)</p>
