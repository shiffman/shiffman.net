<p>So I&#8217;m really a doo-doo head for not bothering to demonstrate this sooner. . . but you can now use my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code/library/">Vector3D class as a library</a>.    Of course, this isn&#8217;t nearly as sophisticated as what you might, say, be able to do with <a href"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~traer/physics/">traer.physics</a>, but since this class is used in virtually all of my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code/">Nature of Code</a> examples, it&#8217;s not such a nice thing to have to keep adding it to each project over and over and over and over again. . .</p>
