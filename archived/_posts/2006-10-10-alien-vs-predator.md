<p>This is a quick visualization of data from the <a href="http://netflixprize.com">netflix prize</a>.  A vertical bar is drawn for every customer rating a movie.

Note how &#8220;Alien&#8221; (on the left) received many ratings of 4 and 5 stars, but &#8220;Predator&#8221; (on the right) mostly received ratings of 4 stars.  This depicts approximately 50,000 customer ratings.</p>
