<a href="http://shiffman.net/itp/omds/videocomments">video comments</a></p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m working on a project at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/">ITP</a> that involves viewer comments on video that are tied to specific points of time in the video.   It needs a new title, something less, i dunno, boring. . .   </p>
<p>I hope to post some videos and use this system at this site at some point. . .  I hope a lot of things, though. . .</p>
