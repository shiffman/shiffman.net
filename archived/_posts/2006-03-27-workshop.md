<p>On Saturday, I gave a <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> workshop at the <a href="http://fm.hunter.cuny.edu/grad_home.shtml">Hunter College Integrated Media Arts (IMA) MFA program</a>, sponsored by the <a href="http://colab.hunter.cuny.edu/colabcms/">Colab program</a>.  It was rather insane to try to cover what I usually do in <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/icm/shiffman/">an entire semester</a> over a period of 4 hours, nonetheless, I had a terrific amount of fun blabbing on and on and on and, at the very least, <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/workshop/">a nice set of examples </a> (26 total!) emerged.  <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/workshop/">It&#8217;s all here</a>.</p>
<p>Some comments about the workshop also ended up on <a href="http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/2006/03/25/processing-recent-visits/">Grand Text Auto</a> and on <a href="http://abstrakt.vade.info/?p=55">Vade</a>.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be doing another session on April 29th. . .</p>
