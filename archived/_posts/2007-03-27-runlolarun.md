<p>Working on a demo for the <a href="http://shiffman.net/2007/03/02/most-pixels-ever/">MPE</a> system consisting a grid of cells, each playing the film <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/runlolarun/">Run Lola Run</a> at 60&#215;32 pixels.  Each cell is one frame behind (or ahead) of its left (or right) neighbor.  The idea here is to ultimately have enough pixel space to display the entire movie all at once (much like Brendan Dawes&#8217; <a href="http://www.brendandawes.com/sketches/redux/">Cinema Redux</a>), only in motion.  Too bad this is quite a blatant copyright violation.  </p>
