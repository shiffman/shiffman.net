<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I published a new work.  But there&#8217;s nothing like a deadline.  A year ago, I installed three of my works at the <a href="http://www.telfair.org/buildings/jepson.asp">Jepson Center for the Arts</a> in Savannah, GA.  Since the installation was set to run for three years, it seemed like a nice, altogether reasonable thing to say &#8220;Well, how about in a year, I come back and swap out one of my old pieces for a new one?&#8221;   A year quickly fills up with <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching">teaching</a>, working on a <a href="http://book.shiffman.net">book</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livin'_La_Vida_Loca">living la vida loca</a>.  Nevertheless, here I am, a week from heading back down to Savannah and spending all day programming again.</p>
<p>When I first developed the two generative pieces, <a href="http://shiffman.net/projects/swarm">swarm</a> and <a href="http://shiffman.net/projects/mosaic">mosaic</a>, I always imagined them part of a series of three.  I was working on my ITP thesis, an exploration of generative systems in the production of real-time non-photorealistic imagery. Flocking.  Cellular Automata.  The usual.   Having only one semester, I never made it to adopting their formulaic sibling, Fractals (I think I might have to name a pet Fractals some day, kind of like Freckles, only nerdier.)   Looking at how L-Systems work (which we do in my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/the-nature-of-code">nature of code</a> class), the idea was to create a generative garden of abstract and algorithmic trees, shrubs, and flowers, growing on and about the screen, creating a nice little digital painting of the viewer. </p>
<p>Some screenshots and a video (first one is me, second one is my dog, Petey &#8220;Fractals&#8221; Caloyeras):</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not entirely satisfied with the result, as of yet.  It&#8217;s nice to look at, but it&#8217;s just the <a href="http://shiffman.net/projects/swarm/">swarm</a> effect duplicated, only instead of smearing pixels with in a flocking pattern, they are smeared in a recursive tree pattern.  I like to keep things simple, but perhaps augmenting the interaction in such a way that, at the very least, the viewer has a sense of &#8220;planting seeds&#8221; might improve the experience.  I also intend to try some <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/">more sophisticated plant patterns</a>, but with only one day of experimenting, keeping it <a href="http://lawsofsimplicity.com/">simple</a> for now. . .</p>
<p>Ok, so I will probably go back to using the <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/research/?page_id=34">video comments</a> plug-in for posting video, but how could I live one more day without at least publishing one video to YouTube??</p>
