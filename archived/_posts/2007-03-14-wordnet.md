<p>I&#8217;ve posted <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/wordnet/">a brief tutorial</a> on using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet">JWNL</a>, a Java library for accessing <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;WordNet is a large lexical database of English, developed under the direction of George A. Miller. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how useful it would be to create a <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> library with some basic WordNet functionality (or that simply exists as an interface to JWNL for all things WordNet.)   There are many lovely examples of text-based Processing work out there.  Two that jump to mind are <a href="http://stateoftheunion.onetwothree.net/">State of the Union</a> by Brad Borevitz as well as anything ever made by <a href="http://www.chronotext.org/">Ariel Malka</a>.    </p>
<p>The power of WordNet is not that it provides access to word meanings (which it does), but that it provides information about the relationships between words (and when I say &#8220;word,&#8221; I really mean set of synonyms, or <i>synset</i>).   It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">myspace</a> for semantic concepts.    You&#8217;re probably familiar with synonyms and antonyms.  In addition, WordNet provides links for less well-known semantic relationships, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernym">hypernymy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponym">hyponymy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meronymy">meronymy</a>, troponymy, and entailment.  Do I see some sort of tree / network visualization in Processing&#8217;s future?</p>
