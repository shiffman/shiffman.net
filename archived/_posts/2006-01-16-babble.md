<p>&#8220;Babble&#8221; is a quick experiment inspired by <a href="http://www.beardofbees.com/gnoetry.html">Gnoetry</a>.  Gnoetry creates poetry by placing words next to each other according to how they appear statistically in a source text.  Babble does exactly the same thing, however, on a character by character level.   Babble analyzes a source text and calculates the probability for any character to appear after another character, generating a new text based on these probabilities.  The result is mostly gibberish, but some amusing text emerges that vaguely resembles actual language.   This will be greatly improved after I upgrade it to compute the probabilities for each character to appear in triplets (instead of pairs). . .</p>
<p>Can you guess the source text for this demo?</p>
