<p><a href="http://shiffman.net/projects/swarm/">Swarm</a> is at the <a href="http://www.mtr.org/">Museum of Television and Radio</a> in the Spielberg Gallery as part of the <a href="http://www.mtr.org/events/beyondtv/index.htm">Studio IMC</a> show.   I really don&#8217;t have any reason for posting this here other than I wanted to somehow associate the name &#8220;Spielberg&#8221; with my blog . . .</p>
