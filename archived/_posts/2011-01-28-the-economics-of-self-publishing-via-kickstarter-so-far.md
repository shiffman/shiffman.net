<p>Ever since I launched the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiffman/the-nature-of-code-book-project">Nature of Code kickstarter page</a> I&#8217;ve been getting a ton of questions about the economics of this book project.   Though I hate to take any precious moments away from the actual writing of the book, I thought I&#8217;d take some time to lay out some thoughts.  This is all an experiment, and one that I hope will help future authors with evaluating the pros and cons of self-publishing.   So in the interest of transparency here is where I sit at the moment.  Admittedly I&#8217;m flying by the seat of my pants.</p>
<p>Originally I had planned to raise approximately $5,000.  My thought was as follows.  I want to hire an editor (done! the wonderful <a href="http://shannonhunt.com/">Shannon Hunt</a>).   I want to hire a designer.  I want to hire an illustrator.  I want to hire some technical reviewers.  I haven&#8217;t worked out the exact costs, but I was planning on spending somewhere between one and three thousand dollars on each of the above, depending on the scope of work, etc.  I had always planned to fork out some cash out of pocket, but figured kickstarter would ease the burden.  Let&#8217;s just say, as a rough wild guess estimate, I&#8217;m going to spend $6,000 on any labor associated with production (editing, design, technical review, proofreading, etc.)  Come to think of it, that might be a bit low, but that&#8217;s the number I&#8217;m sticking with for now.</p>
<p>Next, there&#8217;s the matter of printing the book itself.   I haven&#8217;t sorted this out either, but I&#8217;m planning on using a print-on-demand service (such as <a href="http://www.lulu.com">lulu</a>).  Let&#8217;s say the book ends up around 350 pages and costs $15 to print each copy (might be less, might be more, depending on quality, etc.).   As of this writing I have 283 pre-orders on kickstarter for the print book.  That&#8217;s $4,245.   Then I&#8217;ll probably want to send out some free copies, review copies for teachers, review copies for bloggers, press, etc. Let&#8217;s say I send out 50 free copies.   There&#8217;s another $750.   Oh right, and shipping and handling.  Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s $3 per book.  (Once the book is out, shipping and handling will be passed onto the customer, but I&#8217;ll be handling it for all kickstarter &#8220;pre-orders&#8221;.)    So another $999 for shipping.</p>
<p>So now (with some rounding) we have $6,000 (fees + labor) + $5,000 (first round of printing) + $1,000 (shipping). A total of $12,000.  </p>
<p>Kickstarter money to date: $12,167.</p>
<p>Total profit: $167</p>
<p>(Note I&#8217;ve ignored some important details like Kickstarter&#8217;s 5%, but this is close enough).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.  That might not seem so great.  But it is. It&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s amazing.  What it means for me is that I&#8217;ve written a book (and published it).  It also means that I own (exclusively) all of the content in the book.  It means that if I continue to sell the book as a PDF, I keep 100% of the price (minus any transaction fees).    Let&#8217;s take my first book <a href="http://www.learningprocessing">Learning Processing</a>, published by MKP/Elsevier.  I think for a kindle version, I barely end up with a dollar (I need to check this, maybe it&#8217;s more like 2, but in any case, it&#8217;s something quite small).</p>
<p>Regarding print copies, with Learning Processing (which retails at the somewhat ridiculous price of $50), I receive approximately $3 per copy sold (very rough estimate).  This self-published book could theoretically reach the customer for $25 (half the price!) and I would receive ~$10 for that copy.  </p>
<p>And if I want to put all the content online for free as tutorials, I can.  </p>
<p>So, this is where I stand as far as today.  Really though, what I care about the most is just writing the darn thing.  So back to that.</p>
