<p>This semester, I&#8217;ve started working on expanding my <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/nature">nature of code tutorials</a> into a book.  My plan is to self-publish (looking into a few options) and have drafts available for download / purchase as early as this summer.  I&#8217;ll also be publishing excerpts from the book as tutorials on <a href="http://www.processing.org/learning/tutorials/">processing.org</a> (the first will be a PVector tutorial) and on this site as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com/noc/">sign up for e-mail updates about the book</a></p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com/noc/table_of_contents.pdf">PDF of the draft table of contents</a> for those who are curious.   Feedback is welcome!</p>
