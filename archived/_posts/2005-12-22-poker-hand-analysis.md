<p>Poker is a little hobby of mine and I&#8217;ve been keeping track of hands played (in computerized versions of the game) in a database.  Amusingly enough, over the last several years, I&#8217;ve collected about 16,000 hands.  I&#8217;m interested in creating some visualizations with this massive amount of data. . .  A first, rather rudimentary pass (built with <a href="http://shiffman.net/">Processing</a>) is at the link above.  It shows Texas Hold&#8217;em starting hands and their win rate  &#8212; green for good, red for bad, the brighter, the better/worse (the values are all normalized so the betting amounts are irrelevant, each hand is valued according to it&#8217;s average &#8220;unit&#8221; win per time played. &#8220;s&#8221; indicates if the hand is suited, &#8220;o&#8221; for offsuit)  The obvious ones &#8212; AA, KK, QQ, AK &#8212; are best, of course.  What&#8217;s interesting to see are the hands that are overplayed &#8212; QJ suited, Q10 suited, J10 suited.  Oh, they sure do look pretty, don&#8217;t they. . .  Of course, this takes very little into account, nothing about how many players, limits, position, etc.   But it&#8217;s a start. . . </p>
