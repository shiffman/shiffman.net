<p>Ok, so I may very well be one of the slowest writers ever, but I am pleased to finally announce that I have completed a draft chapter for what I hope will become my next book: <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com/noc/">The Nature of Code</a>.  Based on my experience getting <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com">Learning Processing</a> out into the world I&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and experiment with self-publishing.  I&#8217;m not sure what service I&#8217;ll ultimately use or exactly how I&#8217;ll distribute the text (most likely as a PDF for sale online as well as print-on-demand physical book) so feel free to write me with suggestions, etc.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a moment to go over some of the finer points as to why I am doing this.</p>
<h2>Dollars and cents</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com">Learning Processing</a> retails for $49.95 (amazon&#8217;s discount is 10%: $44.95).  When the publisher sells a copy of the book, I get some money (yay for me!).  Based on my first royalty statement, this works out to approximately $3.73 per copy.  Sure, I&#8217;m not writing books about programming with <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> to get rich, but I did spend a couple years working hard on the project and every little bit counts.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume for the moment that I could sell the same exact book via <a href="http://www.lulu.com">lulu.com</a>.   The actual cost for printing the book would be ~$14.00.  Ok, so let&#8217;s say I choose to sell the book at $25.00 (half the actual current cost.)   That&#8217;s $11 of profit for every book sold, lulu takes 20%, leaving me with ~$8.80 per book sold.  The book costs half as much and I get more than double the revenue!  Now, this is just one scenario.  I haven&#8217;t decided what service to use, how much of a mark-up is appropriate, etc.  But you get the idea.   There&#8217;s no reason a no color, no frills, beginner programming text needs to be $50.00.</p>
<h2>Release early, Release often</h2>
<p>As an author, it&#8217;s just nice to have a lot of flexibility with the process.  With self-publishing, I can do things like release early drafts of PDFs online for feedback (see below).  This is not something I could have easily done with a traditional publishing house.  Instead of spending months or years writing a book before anyone sees anything, the idea is that I can just put stuff out there (for cheap) as I type and then iterate.  And there are no limits of how I choose to distribute the book (excerpts published as tutorials on Processing.org? Free on my site? PDF for a million dollars?  Audio book? It&#8217;s all fair game.). </p>
<p>Once the book is done, I can easily continue to make changes and update.  Now, Processing has a fairly stable API, one that is not going to undergo massive changes anytime soon.  And sure, how gravity works, the formula for the mandelbrot set, these aren&#8217;t concepts that are going to change that often.  Nevertheless, anytime you write a technical book, technology changes faster than you can write, and no matter how careful you are, there&#8217;s no way to avoid making a serious amount of mistakes.  With self-publishing and print-on-demand, I don&#8217;t have to wait (possibly years) for a print run to finish selling in order to make changes.   I could make them <b><i>daily</i></b> if I wanted to.  And that Chapter on PHP that I realized I really should have included in Learning Processing, well, I could just add it whenever I so choose.</p>
<h2>Downfalls</h2>
<p>There are certainly some pitfalls to self-publishing.  One major issue, of course, is deadlines.  Without a publisher I&#8217;ve got very little pushing me forward other than myself.  In fact, getting this first chapter done took me twice as long as I intended.  And other projects are getting in the way, I&#8217;m not sure how fast I will actually get to chapter #2.  </p>
<p>The other main issue is distribution.  I don&#8217;t care if I don&#8217;t get my book in Barnes and Noble, I mean who is really buying Processing books at Barnes and Noble?!   I do need Amazon.com, but looks like there are plenty of print-on-demand options that can be distributed via Amazon.  The major question for me is university bookstores.  I don&#8217;t have any numbers, but it does seem to me that Learning Processing gets stocked in a lot of school bookstores because it is being used as a text for classes.  So this is something I need to figure out, how can I get a self-published book to stores.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, an index.  The publisher made an index for me.  There&#8217;s got to be a way I don&#8217;t need them for that, though.</p>
<p>In the end, I could be wrong.  This could be a failed experiment.  Maybe no one will buy it, maybe I won&#8217;t finish it.  The nice thing, however, is that if I&#8217;m really headed in the wrong direction here, I can always change my mind and start sending out proposals to a publisher.  But the other way around, going from a publisher to self-published, well, that wouldn&#8217;t be so easy.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in checking out what I&#8217;ve started so far, for now (subject to change), you can purchase the PDF on lulu.com.  I&#8217;m selling draft chapters for small amounts with the idea that I could raise a little bit of money to pay for design, typesetting, technical editing, etc. once I&#8217;ve got a more finished draft.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I&#8217;m also looking for a service that would let users buy early drafts of a book and then upgrade to the final version at a discount or for free.  Suggestions for how to do this welcome.</p>
