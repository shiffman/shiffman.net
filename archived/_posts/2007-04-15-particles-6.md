<p></a><a href="http://www.flight404.com/">Flight404&#8242;s</a> <a href="http://www.flight404.com/blog/?p=74">recent exquisite work with additive blending and particles</a> led me to return to <a href="http://shiffman.net/projects/super-shiny-happy-particles">an old project of mine</a>.   Of course, these days, revisiting a project translates to &#8220;add more LCD screens.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve successfully added support for passing larger amount of data across clients in the <a href="http://shiffman.net/2007/03/02/most-pixels-ever/">multi-screen</a> framework and this has led to some nice experiments, including having one client capture video for the entire system.   The demo below involves 3 client computers, 6 LCD screens, and 2 video cameras.   Did I mention this is all works with <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>???</p>

<p>Now, I have to admit.  I have a problem.  When I had one screen, I wished for two.  When two came, I wished for 3.  Then 6.  Now, I wish for 12.  (Well, I would really quite prefer in the vincinity of 96 screens, but I have to be realistic.)</p>
