<p><a href="http://faludi.com">Rob Faludi</a> and I are working on a Processing library for Digiâ€™s <a href="http://www.digi.com/products/wireless/point-multipoint/xbee-series1-module.jsp">XBee Series 1 radios</a>.  Direct from <a href="http://blog.faludi.com/2007/12/19/xbee-api-library-for-processing/">Rob&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>
<p><i>The library currently facilitates receiving single sample I/O packets in <a href="http://www.digi.com/support/kbase/kbaseresultdetl.jsp?kb=184">API mode</a>, and returns an object that contains the analog values, digital values, senderâ€™s 16-bit address and RSSI value. The next tasks will be to receive regular RX frames, issue AT commands and receive responses, issue TX frames and receive responses to those. Weâ€™d also like to support the XBee Series 2 radios, which have a similar API structure.</i></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where you can <a href="http://blog.faludi.com/code/xbee-api-library-for-processing/">download and learn about the library</a>.</p>
