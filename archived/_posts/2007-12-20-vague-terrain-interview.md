<p>I&#8217;m behind updating this place so here come three quick holiday blog posts. . .   First one is just a link to an <a href="http://www.vagueterrain.net/content/archives/journal08/shiffman01.html">interview with me on Vague Terrain</a> conducted by <a href="http://www.mantissa.ca/">Jeremy Rotsztain</a>.  Jeremy&#8217;s project <a href="http://www.mantissa.ca/itp/slowdown.html">Slow Down West Side Highway</a> was featured in the ITP Big Screens show, which will be the subject of the next post. . .</p>
