<p>I recently participated in <a href="http://7in7.tumblr.com/">7 in 7</a>, a scheme cooked up by the ITP resident researchers to do seven creative projects in seven days.  The project inspired the currently running and oh so more manageable <a href="http://5-in-5.com/">5 in 5</a>.  The rules are:</p>
<p><i>Projects must be completed in a day.</i><br />
<i>Each project needs a name and documentation posted by the end of the day.</i></p>
<p>Although I did complete seven projects, it took me nine days, and some of the projects were arguably not <i>creative</i>, but rather a quick experiment or a &#8220;i&#8217;ve been meaning to do this for the last five years so let me see if I can just get it started in one hour&#8221; deal-ee-o.  Code-wise I worked on <a href="http://7in7.tumblr.com/post/38698361/im-working-through-the-really-terrific-book">adapting examples into Java</a> from the wonderful book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/">Collective Intelligence</a> by Toby Segaran, <a href="http://7in7.tumblr.com/post/38506726/www-lulu-com-content-2717766-while-im-waiting">began the process of thinking about self-publishing a book</a>,  and developed a quick <a href="http://7in7.tumblr.com/post/38431191/ive-adapted-my-spam-filtering-example-from">bayesian classification Processing library</a> (which I would like to make more fully functional), among <a href="http://7in7.tumblr.com/">other things</a>.  </p>
<p>Best of luck to the five in fivers, look forward to seeing the results!  And a quick plug to the ITP residents&#8217; show, which will be this Saturday, August 2nd!  <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/show/residents2008/">Details here</a>.</p>
