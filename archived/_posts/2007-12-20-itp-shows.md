<p>The <a href="">ITP Show</a> finished up with some nice write-ups on the internets: <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/object-oriented-objects-at-nyu/">ny times blog</a> and <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2007/12/itp_winter_show_highlight.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">MAKE</a>.</p>
<p>About a week or so before the ITP show, my <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/bigscreens/">Big Screens</a> class had their own show at the <a href="http://iacbuilding.com/interactive/content.html">IAC Building</a> on their rather large video wall.  I&#8217;m hoping we set the world record for largest Processing sketch ever.   Some photos (video coming soon):</p>

<p>This, as far as I know, was the first public use of the <a href="http://mostpixelsever">Most Pixels Ever</a> library, which admittedly needs quite a bit of work still.</p>
