<p>I made this example earlier in the semester after seeing countless projects with the following functionality: turning a sound on when a sensor reading reaches a given level, turning the sound off when a sensor reading falls below a certain level.  Most the projects used Minim for sound playback and pause() and play() to start and stop a sound, along with rewind() to send the sound back to the beginning.  While this does work, I find a more effective strategy is to fade a sound in and out using shiftGain().</p>
<p>Now this is a fairly simple problem if you can pinpoint the moment a sound should fade in.  For example, let&#8217;s say you want it to happen when the mouse is clicked.</p>

{% highlight java %}
void mousePressed() {
  player.shiftGain(-80, 13, 1000); 
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The above line of code will fade the sound over 1,000 milliseconds (i.e. 1 second) from a decibel level of -80 (inaudible) to 13 (some vaguely loud level.)</p>
<p>If you put this code in draw(), however, you&#8217;ve got a problem.</p>

{% highlight java %}
void draw() {
  if (sensorVal > threshold) {
    player.shiftGain(-80, 13, 1000); 
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can&#8217;t call shiftGain() over and over again!  You want this to happen just once, the moment the sensor value reaches that threshold.  Introducing a boolean is a quick way to solve this problem.  If you set the boolean to true when the sound is fading and only call shiftGain() when the boolean is set to false, you&#8217;ve now got only one call to the function.</p>

{% highlight java %}
boolean fade = false;

void draw() {
  if (sensorVal > threshold &#038;&#038; !fade) {
    player.shiftGain(-80, 13, 1000); 
    fade = true;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The question remains: when does fade get set back to false?  One likely solution is to reset the boolean when the sensor value falls below the threshold, i.e.</p>

{% highlight java %}
  if (sensorVal > threshold &#038;&#038; !fade) {
    player.shiftGain(-80, 13, 1000); 
    fade = true;
  } else if (sensorVal < threshold) {
    fade = false;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Following is an example that does this with a double threshold (fading up above a value and fading down below a value).  In addition, it offers some other improvements (such as having the sound fade from its current gain level). The mouseX location is the stand-in for a sensor value.</p>
