<p>Location: Guenzel Gallery @ Peninsula School of Art</p>
<p>Recording our everyday lives has gone from the privacy and simplicity of writing in a diary to real-time, digital exposure on the internet. This exhibit reveals the many ways we see ourselves in the 21st century. Watch your portrait quickly emerge from lively patterns on a flat screen TV, view an artist’s 70lb weight loss via video in a matter of minutes, or experience a decade of an artist’s life through daily Polaroids. These works and more showcase the art of today’s self-portrait. Free and open to the public. 920-868-3455 www.peninsulaartschool.com; e-mail: staff@peninsulaartschool.com.</p>
