<p>Just a quick note to let you know that my book, <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com">Learning Processing</a>, is now available for purchase.  If you are local to NYC, you can buy the book at the <a href="http://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/">NYU bookstore</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Processing-Beginners-Programming-Interaction/dp/0123736021/">Amazon says &#8220;out of stock&#8221;</a>, but I&#8217;m told by the publisher that this is an error and they do, in fact, have copies. Also, <a href="http://search.a1books.com/cgi-bin/mktSearch?act=showDesc&#038;code=gbase&#038;rel=1&#038;ITEM_CODE=0123736021#minPrice">at $37.00, this seems to be the cheapest option online</a> that I can find.</p>
<p>All the example code will be available live online at <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com">learningprocessing.com</a> by early next week.  Feel free to contact me with comments, questions, feedback!</p>
<p>Who is this book for?  Check out <a href="http://shiffman.net/2008/07/31/book-release-learning-processing/">my earlier post</a>.</p>
