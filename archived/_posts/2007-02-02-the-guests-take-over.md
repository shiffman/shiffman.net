<p>Today, my site had a slight breakdown.  For whatever reason, the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> <a href="http://www.semiologic.com/software/google-analytics/">plug-in</a> made the site disappear.  If you weren&#8217;t logged in as an &#8220;author&#8221;, nothing would appear.  So before I could figure out the problem, I enabled author capabilities for all my students so that they could continue to view the material.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is fixed.  So I could turn it off.  But let&#8217;s just let it go a little bit longer.</p>
