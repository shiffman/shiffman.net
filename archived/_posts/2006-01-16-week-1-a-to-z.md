<p><a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/week-1-a-to-z/">My first tutorial</a> for my new course <a href="http://shiffman.net/teaching/programming-from-a-to-z/">Programming from A to Z</a> is up and online.  I&#8217;m having an issue on the site where wordpress is adding extra slashes before quotes when I post code using the pre-formatted tags. . . still have a few things to clean-up, but it&#8217;s there now. . . .  comments, suggestions, critiques welcome!   The examples are currently all Java, but hopefully I&#8217;ll have Perl and PHP versions up soon. . .</p>
