<p>I recently had the true pleasure of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shiffman/sets/72157607428842778/">spending a weekend</a> with the creators of <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, <a href="http://reas.com/">Casey Reas</a> and <a href="http://benfry.com/">Ben Fry</a>, at Miami University.  Ira Greenberg, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Processing-Creative-Coding-Computational-Foundation/dp/159059617X?&#038;camp=212361&#038;creative=383841&#038;linkCode=wss&#038;tag=learniproces-20">Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art</a> and newly minted shepherd of <a href="http://processing.org/hacks/doku.php">Processing hacks</a>, organized the weekend and I am extremely grateful for being invited to tag along.   I focused mostly on putting together a <a href="http://processing.org/learning/tutorials/">set of tutorials</a> for the Processing web site, some adapted from my new book <a href="http://www.learningprocessing.com">Learning Processing</a>.   The hope is to really flesh this section of the site out so if anyone has a tutorial they&#8217;d like to contribute, please feel free to write.  We&#8217;ll be doing this again a few more times this year (perhaps even having a session at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu">ITP</a>!).  I&#8217;m looking forward to many more wacky Processing adventures.  </p>

<blockquote><p>
Miami University is generously funding a series of Processing development workshops. The first workshop took place from 18 to 21 September. Ben Fry, Dan Shiffman, Ira Greenberg, and myself worked together to improve the examples, start a series of tutorials, and work through some conceptual issues related to adding a new PShape class. Additional topics included the future of Processingâ€™s libraries and other implementations of Processing (C++, Ruby, Python, etc.) Ira Greenberg, an associate professor at Miami and author of â€œProcessing: Creative Coding and Computational Artâ€, got this started and weâ€™re very grateful for the support of the Interactive Media Studies (IMS) program, directed by Glenn Platt. The next Oxford Project will take place from 20 to 23 November.
