<h3>Level III: Creative Visualization</h3>
<br><br>
The previous examples offer a basic introduction to image processing.  There are many
advanced algorithms that you could research online to achieve all sorts of effects.
However, it's often more interesting to create your own drawing system that simply
uses the color information from an image as a data source.
<br><br>
For example, we might draw a large number of ellipses randomly scattered throughout the
screen.  If we look up colors from the image when we draw the ellipses, we can achieve
a "pointillist-like" effect.

You might also try experimenting with the translate and rotate commands from week 8
in visualizing the data from an image.  This example draws a grid of rectangles colored
from the image, with each rectangle translated along the z axis by its brightness.
