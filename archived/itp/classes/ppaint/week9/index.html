<h3>What is image processing?</h3>

From <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/experiences/glossary_h-n.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/experiences/glossary_h-n.asp</a>
<br><br>
Image processing is defined as "the analysis, manipulation, storage, and display of graphical images from sources such as
photographs, drawings, and video. Image processing spans a sequence of three steps.
The input step (image capture and digitizing) converts the differences in coloring and
shading in the picture into binary values that a computer can process. The processing step
can include image enhancement and data compression. The output step consists of the display
or printing of the processed image. Image processing is used in such applications as television
and film, medicine, satellite weather mapping, machine vision, and computer–based pattern
recognition."
<br><br>
This week, we'll look at a series of image processing examples implemented in processing.  They
will be grouped in 3 stages.  Let's call them:
<br><br>
<li>Level 1: Pixel Point Processing</li>
<li>Level 2: Pixel Group Processing</li>
<li>Level 3: Creative Visualizations</li>
<br><br>
<h3>Processing: The PIXEL array and LOCATION calculation</h3>

In processing, we can get at the pixels of the display window, using the array "pixels".
Each pixel on the screen has an X,Y coordinate.  However, the array "pixels" in a one-dimensional array.
In other words, we need to think of every pixel as living in 2 dimensions, but access
the information in one.  We can do this through the following formula:
<br>
<br>1. Assume a window or image with a given WIDTH and HEIGHT.
<br>2. We then know the pixel array has a total number of elements equaling WIDTH * HEIGHT.
<br>3. For any given point in the windows (X,Y), the location in our 1 dimensional pixel array is:
<br><br>
<b>LOCATION = X + Y*WIDTH</b>
<br><br>
Examine the following simple example.  This program sets each pixel in a 50x50 window
to a random grayscale value.  Note the use of a nested loop for each XY coordinate
in combination with our location formula from above.
<br><br>
<applet code="week9a" archive="week9a.jar" width=50 height=50></applet>
<pre>
size(50,50);
//nested loop to walk through every x and y coordinate
//like with our 2D array
for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
  for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    //pick a random number, 0 to 255
    int rand = int(random(255));
    //create a grayscale color based on random number
    color c = color(rand,rand,rand);
    //do our location calculation
    int loc = x + y*width;
    //set pixel at that location to random color
    pixels[loc] = c;
  }
}
</pre>
If you examine the above program closely, you may notice that a nested loop and location calculation
is not required here.
Rather, we could have used a single for loop to walk through every element of the display window's pixel
array.  However, we use a nested loop with X and Y because as we move towards more advanced image
processing functions, this will be required.
<Br><br>
<h3>Level 1: Pixel Point Operations</h3>
We're going to take a step forward from the previous example and instead of setting every pixel
to a random color, we're going to pull colors from an image and set colors in our display window
accordingly.
<br><br>
To understand the workings of the code below, you'll want to examine the following processing
reference pages:

<br><br>
Ok, for our first level one example, we want to:

simply load an image, get its pixels, and
repaint it in our display window.
<br><br>
<applet code="week9a_1" archive="week9a_1.jar" width=320 height=240></applet>
<pre>
BImage a;

void setup()
{
  size(320, 240);
  a = loadImage("sunflower.jpg");
}

void loop()
{
  background(0);

  image(a,0,0);

  for (int x = 0; x < a.width; x++) {
    for (int y = 0; y < a.height; y++ ) {
      //calculate the 1D location from a 2D grid
      int loc = x + y*a.width;
      //get the R,G,B values from image
      float r,g,b;
      r = red   (a.pixels[loc]);
      g = green (a.pixels[loc]);
      b = blue  (a.pixels[loc]);

      //****DO OUR IMAGE PROCESSING STUFF HERE*******/

      //make a new color and set pixel in the window
      color c = color(r,g,b);
      pixels[loc] = c;

    }
  }
}
</pre>

Again, examining the above code closely, we'll notice that we could have done
numerous simplifications in order to merely display the image (for example, we
could just use the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/image_.html">image()</a>
function and skipped all this pixel work.  However, now that we have a framework
for getting the red, green, and blue values for each pixel, we can now move on
and perform simple image processing techniques.
