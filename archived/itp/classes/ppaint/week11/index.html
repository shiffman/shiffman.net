<h3>Computer Vision</h3>
Computer vision refers to the the field of research that studies ways computers can
gather and interpret visual information (usually via a digital video camera.)  We're interested
in how techniques employed in computer vision algorithms can be used to enhance
screen (and non-screen) based interactive systems.
You'll find some resources here:

In working with processing, you might also make use of Josh Nimoy's "WebCamXtra", a software library
for Processing, Java, and Macromedia Director (Windows and Mac OS X.)  WebCamXtra has simple-to-use
advanced features, such as color tracking, glob detection, etc.  For more information, please visit:

<br><br>
For our purpose, we will look at a two very basic examples of how to track a given color in a
video image.  Our methods won't be as robust or sophisticated as advance CV programs, but the underlying principle
will be the name:<br>
<li>open video stream</li>
<li>use a nested for loop to analyze all pixels of each frame</li>
<li>develop an algorithm/test to evaluate the pixels based on a set of conditions
(such as locating the pixel with the brightest color)</li>


<h3>Tracking Brightness</h3>



This first example checks the brightness of each pixel of each frame, saving the location
for the brightest pixel in a variable.  It then draws a rectangle at the location of the brightest
pixel.

The next example employs the same method as above, however, instead of tracking the brightness
of a pixel, it tracks how close any given pixel is to a certain color (the color is determined by
the user clicking the mouse on a certain pixel.)  To calculate the difference between two colors,
we use the following formula (assume two variables of type color, color1 and color2):
<pre>
float r1 = red(color1); float g1 = green(color1); float b1 = blue(color1);
float r2 = red(color2); float g2 = green(color2); float b2 = blue(color2);
float diff = sqrt(sq(r1 - r2) + sq(g1 - g2) + sq(b1 - b2));
</pre>
