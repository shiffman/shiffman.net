# The category of your library, must be one (or many) of the following:

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence = HTTP Requests for Processing is a small library that takes the pain out of doing HTTP requests in Processing.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the

# mention it here.

# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your library is known to
# break in a later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
