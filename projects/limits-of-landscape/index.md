<p>Created in collaboration with <a href="http://demonchaux.com">Nicholas de Monchaux</a>.</p>
<p>This installation, titled <strong><em>Limits of Landscape</em></strong>, is prompted by the growing distance between two scales; the scale of the body, and the scale at which technological change is shaping our environment. From the microscopic to the global, the interconnected systems we inhabit are undergoing rapid, and unprecedented change. However, the seeming imperceptibility of these changes at the scale of our body can make them all but invisible. From Carbon Dioxide emissions to genetic modifications, we find it hard, literally, to see the change in the landscape we inhabit.</p>
<p>The Exhibit was installed at a conference sponsored by The Landscape Architecture Foundation and the University of Virginia School of Architecture, Sept 5-6 2003. The installation was exhibited in the Victor and Sona Elemah Gallery from September 4-16. </p>
